Underwater Image Restoration Through a Prior Guided Hybrid Sense Approach and Extensive Benchmark Analysis  
*Summarized on August 3, 2025*

1. **Introduction / Abstract**  
The paper addresses the problem of underwater images suffering from color distortions (mainly blue or green hues) and blurriness caused by light absorption and scattering in water. These issues degrade image quality and hinder tasks like marine object recognition. The authors propose a novel underwater image restoration (UIR) framework called GuidedHybSensUIR, which combines multi-scale processing with a new Color Balance Prior (a guide based on average RGB channel values) to correct color casts and restore details. Their method integrates convolutional neural networks (**CNNs**, which extract local image features) and Transformers (models that capture long-range dependencies) in a hybrid architecture. They also create a comprehensive benchmark dataset from multiple real-world underwater image datasets and evaluate 37 existing methods, showing that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques overall.

2. **Methodology**  
The GuidedHybSensUIR framework uses a U-shaped network architecture with three main components:  
- **Detail Restorer**: A CNN-based module that restores fine, local image details at multiple scales using quaternion convolutions (a mathematical way to represent RGB channels jointly) to better capture color interdependencies. It combines two blocks: Residual Context Block (RCB) for contextual information and Nonlinear Activation-Free Block (NAFB) for efficient feature processing.  
- **Feature Contextualizer**: A Transformer-based module at the network bottleneck that models global, long-range relationships and color dependencies using three types of inter-channel attention mechanisms—Adjust Color Transformer (ACT), Keep Feature Transformer (KFT), and Self-Attention Transformer (SAT). These attentions focus on refining color and feature information guided by the Color Balance Prior.  
- **Scale Harmonizer**: A module in the decoder that fuses multi-scale features from the encoder and bottleneck, harmonizing them through learnable scaling and shifting parameters to produce a high-quality restored image.  
The Color Balance Prior is computed as the average of the RGB channels per pixel, serving as a strong guide during feature contextualization and a weak guide during decoding to steer color correction. The model is trained with a composite loss combining pixel fidelity, structural similarity, and perceptual quality.

3. **Theory / Mathematics**  
The Color Balance Prior is based on the Gray World Assumption, which states that in a normally illuminated scene, the average intensities of the red, green, and blue channels should be equal (neutral gray). Mathematically, the observed pixel intensity in channel i at position (x,y) is:  
fi(x,y) = G(x,y) * Ri(x,y) * Ii(x,y)  
where G is a geometry factor, R is the object's reflectance (true color), and I is the illumination. Assuming constant geometry and uniform reflectance distribution, the average intensity ai of each channel is proportional to its illumination Ii. In air, all Ii are equal, so:  
aR ≈ aG ≈ aB  
This prior guides the model to restore balanced color intensities, compensating for underwater wavelength-dependent light absorption.  
Quaternion convolution is used to fuse outputs from parallel CNN blocks mathematically, limiting degrees of freedom and stabilizing feature fusion. The quaternion convolution Qout = Q * W uses Hamilton product rules to combine feature maps, capturing inter-channel interactions effectively.  
The inter-channel attention in the Transformer modules computes attention maps across feature channels rather than spatial patches, reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to spatial size. The attention formula is:  
InterCAttn(Q,K,V) = Softmax(Q * K^T / τ) * V  
where Q, K, V are query, key, and value tensors derived from image and prior features, and τ is a learnable temperature parameter.

5. **Conclusion**  
The paper presents a novel underwater image restoration framework that effectively combines CNNs and Transformers guided by a Color Balance Prior to correct color distortions and restore fine details. The hybrid multi-scale architecture and quaternion-based fusion enable stable and comprehensive feature processing. Extensive experiments on a newly compiled benchmark dataset demonstrate that this method outperforms 37 state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and qualitative visual quality across diverse underwater datasets. The Color Balance Prior plays a crucial role in steering the model towards realistic color restoration.  
**Why It Matters:** This research advances underwater imaging by providing a robust, generalizable restoration method that improves the clarity and color accuracy of underwater photos, facilitating better marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and underwater robotics applications.
